The algorithm name used in the SecretKeySpec constructor should correspond to a valid cryptographic algorithm supported
by the Java platform. The algorithm name is typically specified as a string, and it should match the naming conventions
used by the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA).

The algorithm name is case-sensitive and should be specified in the format defined by the JCA, which typically consists
 of a combination of uppercase letters and hyphens. For example, common algorithm names for symmetric encryption
 include "AES", "DES", "3DES", "Blowfish", etc., while algorithm names for hash functions include "SHA-256", "MD5", "SHA-1", etc.


It's important to use a valid and secure cryptographic algorithm that is appropriate for the specific use case and security
requirements of your application. Using weak or deprecated algorithms can result in security vulnerabilities, as they may be
susceptible to attacks. It's recommended to refer to the Java documentation and security guidelines to determine
the appropriate algorithm to use for your specific use case.

"EAS" is not a valid algorithm name for the SecretKeySpec constructor in Java.

The correct algorithm name for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is "AES". It is a widely used and secure symmetric
encryption algorithm that is supported by the Java platform.

Using an incorrect or invalid algorithm name, such as "EAS", will result in an error or unexpected behavior when using the
SecretKeySpec constructor, as it won't be able to recognize the algorithm and properly initialize the key. It's important to
use the correct algorithm name as defined by the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) for the intended cryptographic operation.
